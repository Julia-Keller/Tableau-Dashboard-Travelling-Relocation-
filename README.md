# Data Science Project: NextStop Europe: Discover Your Ideal Travel Destination or New Home

## Project overview and objectives:
This project was developed as a part of the final project for the Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. The goal of this project is to create an interactive Tableau dashboard which could assist users in  making informed decisions about the most suitable travel destinations or potential relocation spots in Europe based on their preferences. 

## Project Contributors:
A team of two people contributed to the creation of the dashboards.
Special thanks to my project partner Priyanka Pawar.

## Project Description:
The project includes two interactive Tableau dashboards in one story:

1. Travelers Dashboard üåç: provides insights to help travelers plan their trips more effectively by selecting the perfect European travel destination based on various criteria such as weather condotions, accomodation prices, safety indices, etc.

2. Relocants Dashboard üè°: tailored for those considering relocation within Europe. The dashboard provides key information on various parameters such as utilities and groceries prices, prices to rent/buy an apartment, cost of living indices and so on which could help users choose the ideal location to live and work.

## Skills & Tools:

Data Collection: Web Scraping, Open APIs, Kaggle Datasets
Data Cleaning & Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization: Tableau, Microsoft AI Designer
Project Management: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub

## Steps of the Project:

## Challenges:
Data Availability: Finding comprehensive and up-to-date datasets that cover all the relevant parameters for travel and relocation decisions was challenging. We had to rely on multiple sources and combine them to create a cohesive dataset.
Data Cleaning: Merging data from different sources required extensive cleaning and normalization to ensure consistency.
Visualization Complexity: Designing dashboards that are both informative and easy to use, while effectively conveying complex data, was a significant challenge.
