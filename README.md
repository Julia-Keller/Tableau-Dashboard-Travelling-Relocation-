# NextStop Europe: Discover Your Ideal Travel Destination or New Home

## Project Overview and Objectives:
This project was developed as a part of the final project for the Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. The goal of this project is to create an interactive Tableau dashboard which could assist users in  making informed decisions about the most suitable travel destinations or potential relocation spots in Europe based on their preferences. 

## Project Contributors:
A team of two people contributed to the creation of the dashboards.
Many thanks to my project partner **Priyanka Pawar** for her expertise, problem-solving skills, commitment and dedication. 

## Project Description:
The project includes two interactive Tableau dashboards in one story:

1. **Travelers Dashboard üåç:** provides valuable insights for travelers seeking the best destinations in Europe. It helps travelers plan their trips more effectively and make decisions based on various criteria such as weather condotions, accommodation costs, air quality, percentage of English-friendly population and entertainment costs.

2. **Relocants Dashboard üè°:** tailored for those considering relocation within Europe. The dashboard provides key information on various parameters such as utilities and groceries prices, rental and buying prices, cost of living, overall  quality of life and so on which could help users choose the ideal location to live and work.

## Steps of the Project:

#### 1. Data Collection:
   - decide which cities will be taken for the analysis;
   - decide which parameters are important for either travellers or relocants;
   - search for open APIs and websites where the data can be taken;
   - explore Kaggle website for relevant Datasets.
#### 2. Data Cleaning & Processing:
   - prepare raw data for analysis by improving its quality and ensuring it is suitable for the intended purpose;
   - identify and remove duplicate entries, detect null values in the dataset, fill missing data or remove irrelevant data from the datasets;
   - convert data types to ensure that variables have the correct format;
   - correct inconsistencies, remove irrelevant characters and symbols;
   - etc.
#### 3. Data Visualization:
   - create a sketch of a future dashboard;
   - combine multiple data sources within Tableau to create unified visualizations;
   - reshape the data and use calculated fields to create new fields, metrics and custom aggregations;
   - chose the right visuatization option for each metric; 
   - combine multiple visualizations into a single dashboard, create interactive filtering and cross-filtering;
   - customize color palettes, add data labels, custom text, modify the size, shape, and design of visual elements;
   - design a sequence of dashboards in one story.

## Skills & Tools:

- **Data Collection**: Web Scraping, Open APIs, Kaggle Datasets
- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: various Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Microsoft AI Designer
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Colab & Jupyter Notebook

## Challenges:

- **Data Availability**: due to data access restrictions and high costs for some data access, it was challenging to find comprehensive and up-to-date datasets that cover all relevant parameters. 
- **Data inconsistency**: we relied on multiple sources and combined them to create a cohesive dataset which led to inconsistency. Merging data from different sources required extensive cleaning and normalization to ensure consistency. 
- **Visualization Complexity**: to balance simplicity for the users and detail was a significant challenge. Chose the right visualization type, provide sufficient context (labels, legends, tooltips) without overloading the user with information was tricky. Also, maintaining consistency in design elements (e.g., colors, scales, formats) across multiple complex visualizations was challenging.

## Deliverables:

1. [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.keller/viz/Next_Stop_Europe/Story1)
2. PowerPoint Presentation (Attached [here](https://github.com/Julia-Keller/Tableau-Dashboard-Travelling-Relocation-/blob/main/Travell%26Relocate_Final_Presentation.pdf))
3. Work notebooks in Jupyter Lab. (Files attached [here](https://github.com/Julia-Keller/Tableau-Dashboard-Travelling-Relocation-/tree/main/Work%20files))

## Future scope:

- **Expansion of Parameters**: Incorporate additional parameters such as more environmental factors, more languages, more cities. 
- **Real-time and Live Data Visualizations**: Connect to real-time data sources like APIs or live databases to continuously update visualizations as new data flows in. 
- **Auto Refresh**: Set auto-refresh intervals for dashboards displaying live data, ensuring that stakeholders always see the most up-to-date information.
- **User Personalization**: Adding features that allow users to input their preferences for a more personalized experience.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Optimizing the dashboards for mobile devices to enhance accessibility and user experience.
